# How to make first wireframe

**An introduction to wireframing**

### What is a wireframe?

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

****Wireframe examples:***

Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create.

That said, for complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:

- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.

- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.

- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

**Things to consider before you start wireframing:**

Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

**The best tools for wireframing:**
There are number of free wireframe tools to experiment and find the one that suit your need. Here are trhree online tools:

- **UXPin:**
UXPin has a wide range of functionalites, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive, clickable prototypes directly in your browser.

- **InVision:**
InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design.

- **Wireframe.cc:**
Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.

Six steps to make wireframe:

1. Do your research:
Remember: UX design is a process, and wireframing isn't the first step in this process. Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, creating user personas and defining use cases, and completing this with further competitor and industry research. What does that mean? That means carrying out analysis of similar product lines to your own, digging into prevailing UX trends and best practises, and of course, reviewing your own internal design guidelines. If you're designing a new feature, don't be afraid to research outside of your domain. Introducing tracking and data visualization as part of your logistics company's service? Perhaps it's worth checking out some fitness or nutrition apps on Dribble or Behance for some ideas. Creativity is often set loose at point where fields of expertise intersect, after all.

2. Prepare your research for quick reference:
You can imagine how much quantitative and qualitative data those various phases will produce. Well, that's what you need to keep in mind while drawing out your wireframes. If you're a mere mortal, you might struggle to both retain and recall all of that, so I recommend scribbling a cheatsheet with your business and user goals (your requirements), your personas, use cases, and perhaps some reminders of the coolest features you stumbled across in your competitor research. A few chice quotes from your audience might also  help focus your attention on the user's experience, which is - never forget - what you are designing.

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out:
Your wireframing is going to get very messy very quickly if you don't have an idea of how many screens you'll need to produce and the flow you expect the user to follow. It's important to have a watertight concept of where your users wil be coming from (which marketing channel, for example, and off the back of what messaging), and where you need them to end up. If you're already well-aquainted with UX vacabulary, your internal voice will be alternately screaming "user flows" and information architecture. Good information architecture will ensure that your users are self-sufficient (fewer messages to your customer service asking how to do something painfully simple), lower levels of user frustration (and ultimately more satisfaction and trust), and therefore lower drop-off or drop-out rates. Which probably means more revenue, and probably means happy managers—and a job well done.

4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate:
A good, thick marker pen (a sharpie) is a handy tool for this stage of wireframing. Why? Because it prevents you from drowing yourself in detail. You will focus on delineating the funtinal blocks that form the skeleton of your design. Ask following questions while you're sketching:

- How can you organise the content to support your users' goals?
- Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
- What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
- Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

5. Add some detail and get testing:
So you have a flow and you have your screens, and you’ve corroborated your ideas with some clued-up colleagues. The next step is to add some informational details to prepare your wireframe for its upgrade, Megatron-style, to prototype-mode.

Add detail in the way you would naturally process a screen, or the page of a book: from top-to-bottom and left-to-right. Remember: Your wireframe is the skeleton of your site. You’re not adding the muscle just yet—the content and the copy. To extend the metaphor somewhat uncomfortably, these elements are the ligaments and tendons that will connect form and functionality. Think about the following:

Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action
Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?
Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
Once you’ve done all that, you’re ready for your first user tests. At this stage, your users may well be your colleagues. Indeed, one of the joys of the humble wireframe is that it serves as a common language between designers, stakeholders and web and app developers. You can use tools like UsabilityHub to preference test screens and collect qualitative feedback, and Prott to test and check understanding of the basic user flow. With this tool, you can simply photograph and upload your hand-sketched wireframes, and then connect them to user button overlays. Clever stuff!

6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes:
Once you’ve documented and acted upon the feedback from your first prototype, you can start developing your high-fidelity prototypes. There are lots of slick tools out there for this, from Proto.io to Adobe XD and Framer, but the most well-known are Sketch and the browser-based, new(ish) kid-on-the-block, Figma. Once you’ve developed your wireframes in Sketch, you can import them into the industry-leading prototyping tool InVision (which, incidentally, we built a course in conjunction with) and interlink your screens for a second round of high-fidelity user testing. It’s at this point that we’ve most certainly crossed from wireframing to prototyping.

## How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles

The following points should be at the forefront of your mind when building your wireframe:

1. **Clarity**
Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.

2. **Confidence**
Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage. Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar–and that’s before you’ve even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles.

3. **Simplicity is key**
Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

Your wireframe should be a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be navigated. Attractiveness at this stage is not a consideration. Once you’ve decided who your product or service is for, you can begin laying out the information they are looking for in an intuitive and natural way that is not only familiar to them as users of this kind of service, but that also guides them towards the conversion point or otherwise helps them to achieve their goals in the interaction. By presenting your information in this way, you are aligning both the business goals of your site with the needs of the customer.
