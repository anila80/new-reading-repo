My name is **Anila Khan** and I am very excited to be on the new journey of my life

## **Growth Mindset:**

  A growth mindset is a fundamental element to success. God gifted talent can only give someone a good start but growth mindset is a key factor to lead you   towards success. It helps you to accept challenges, make you persistent to remain on task, learn from your obstacles and hinderance, simply it just keeps you going and going.

 ### *3 reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:*
 1.	NO PAIN NO GAIN
 2.	If someone else can do this, WHY CAN'T I. I just need some more effort to accomplish!!! ðŸ¥‡
 3.	How to improve my areas where Iâ€™m less proud of?
